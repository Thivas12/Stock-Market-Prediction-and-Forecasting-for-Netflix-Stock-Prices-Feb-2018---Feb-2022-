# Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting for Netflix stock prices using Stacked LSTM
In this project, we will work with netflix stock prices which made into a data which has period Feb 2018 - Feb 2022. So, basically we'll use a combination of AI calculations to forecast this company's future stock price with LSTM.
We'll be using some libraries to work with 
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn

# What is LSTM ? 
LSTM stands for long short-term memory networks, used in the field of Deep Learning. It is a variety of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are capable of learning long-term dependencies, especially in sequence prediction problems. LSTM has feedback connections, i.e., it is capable of processing the entire sequence of data, apart from single data points such as images. This finds application in speech recognition, machine translation, etc. LSTM is a special kind of RNN, which shows outstanding performance on a large variety of problems.
